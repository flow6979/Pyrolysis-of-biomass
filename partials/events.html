              <h2>Process Flow :</h2>
              <div>Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that involves the decomposition of organic materials, such as biomass, in the absence of oxygen. The process typically results in the production of biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. Here is a simplified process flow for the pyrolysis of biomass:
